# ComposingApp

This is going to be a music composing app where users can share their compositions.

## Technologies Used
- Ruby on Rails (backend)
- React.js (frontend)
- Muse (song maker package)
- Devise (user-auth)

## Reach Goals
I'm hoping to make the user experience as efficient as possible.  Letting the user drag notes onto music sheets visually would be awesome. Try to store audio files into psql table or just in a directory.. not sure which would be easier for when the project is deployed.

## Timeline
1. Creating efficient tables (gonna be complicated)
2. Creating basic crud for making empty songs
3. making it as user-friendly as possible
4. pretty it up
